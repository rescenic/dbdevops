1.	Introduction to Database DevOps  
	a.	Intro 
	b.	Challenges for database automation 
		i.	Integrity and security of Production data 
		ii.	Production data vs reference data 
		iii.	Test data (in dev and other pre-Production environments) 
		iv.	The DBA (unfamiliar with tools, change) 
		v.	Environment differences 
		vi.	Dependencies (within database and across databases) 
		vii.	Multiple applications accessing the same db 
		viii.	Database drift (aka – Hot fixes directly to Prod) 
		ix.	Maintaining backwards compatibility 
		x.	Recovering from releases (rollback vs roll forward) 
	c.	Options 
		i.	ORM 
		ii.	State-based 
		iii.	Migrations-based

2.	Including your database in development practices  
	a.	Source controlling your database 
		i.	Migration scripts 
		ii.	Schema 
		iii.	Reference data 
	b.	Including your database in Continuous Integration  
	c.	Continuous unit testing for databases (high level – this could be a class in itself, which we could produce) 
 
3.	Release Management and the database 
	a.	Releasing your database in non-Production and Production environments 
		i.	Staging environments 
		ii.	Manual review steps for Production (comparison report, preview script, review warnings) 
	b.	Validating deployments 
	c.	Dealing with database drift 
	d.	Additional database testing 
		i.	Integration testing 
		ii.	Data generation 
 
4.	Monitoring databases after releasing 
	a.	Understanding how releases impact database servers and performance 
	b.	Dealing with database drift 
	c.	Recovering when things go wrong 
		i.	Importance of backups 
		ii.	Rolling forward 
	 
5.	Advanced topics 
	a.	Provisioning dev and test environments  
	b.	Branching and merging database changes 
	c.	Organizing database releases (semantic versioning) 
	d.	Dealing with differences across environments or customer sites 
		i.	User permissions and roles 
		ii.	Customize releases per customer site (SQLCMD variables)
