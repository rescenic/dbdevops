# What is Release Management?
One of the big inefficiencies of the traditional DBA job is preparing a release of database changes. I've been involved in large releases of months of database changes bundled up that required a week of time to gather the changes, organize them, and then test deployments, worrying all the time that I've forgotten a critical change. 

Plenty of other DBAs go through similar exercises, which create stress and fear over the release process. The fear causes us to delay deployments, stacking even more and more changes up. This process can snowball until we only rarely release large batches of changes, each of these entailing lots of risk.

The idea with DevOps is that we release more often, with smaller changes. These typically are less risky changes, though with databases, this isn't necessarily try. However, we also get practice in releasing changes to give us confidence that we can make database changes when we desire.
