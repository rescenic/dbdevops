# About This Course

## DevOpxXX: Database DevOps

Welcome to the Database DevOps course. This course is part of a series of courses from Microsoft on DevOps techiques and practices. What you will learn in this course:

- Define DevOps
- Indentify the challenges of using databases that are separate from other software languages and platforms
- Include your database code alongside other application code in a version control system (VCS).
- Setup a Continuous Integration (CI) platform for your database code.
- Write and include automated unit tests for your database code.
- Develop an automated release process that deploys database changes to both on premise and cloud databases.
- Understand the use of branching and merging for database code
- Instrument and monitor the database after deployment

This course will focus on the concepts of including your database in a DevOps process, but we will use Microsoft SQL Server and tailor our examples for this platform. Other relational or non-relational database platforms will have similar concepts that can apply, but we will not examine specific techniques for implementing a DevOps process.
