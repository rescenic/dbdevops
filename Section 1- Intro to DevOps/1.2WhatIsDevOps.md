# What is DevOps?

DevOps is a term that has come to mean different things to different people. There are many descriptions of what DevOps encompasses, and how to implement a DevOps team or process inside of a company. However, I like the short description from Donovan Brown of Microsoft. On the screen we can see his quote that say “DevOps is the union of people, process, and products to enable continuous delivery of value to our end users.”

I really like that definition as it shows that the ultimate goal of a DevOps process is to ensure we deliver value to our users. That’s what we want to accomplish, providing something the users of our software, our application, find useful and valuable. Everything is based on delivering results.

How we do that isn’t important, nor is there any one way to do accomplish our goals. We need to use our people working inside of some process, and with some products or tools. But we need to put those things together and ensure that everything works together to produce something valuable.

That’s the goal of DevOps, and ultimately it involves as much a change in people and process as it does using some sort of tool or product. In fact, the people and process change is going to be more important, and certainly going to take longer than implementing any tool.

There’s another part of that post that I want to also quote. It says:
“It is very important to realize that DevOps is not a product.  You cannot buy DevOps and install it.  DevOps is not just automation or infrastructure as code.  DevOps is people following a process enabled by products to deliver value to our end users.”

The important thing to understand as we go through the rest of this course is that the goal of each section is important. While I will show some products and tooling, from both Microsoft and other companies, these products are just one way to accomplish the goal. Whether this is using git to manage our code or deploying automatically with VSTS, there important concept is that you understand how to manage code or deploy code.

There are many more ways to describe DevOps and certainly plenty of different implementations that accomplish the same results. If you want to learn more about general DevOps practices and ideas, take a look at the EdX course from Microsoft: DEV212x Introduction to DevOps
