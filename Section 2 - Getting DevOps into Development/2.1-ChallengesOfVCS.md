#The Challenges of Getting Database Code into a VCS

One of the challenges many developers have with storing their database code in version control is that they often develop code in a tool such as management studio, the code is compiled on the SQL Server instance, and there never is a file that the developer has to save to a VCS.

This is fundamentally different from most other types of development, where a developer works with various text files containing code, saves them, and then compiles or copies them to a server. In relational database development, the code is often never saved as a file, and indeed, the process can be cumbersome getting the code into files.

There is a lack of database development tooling, especially for SQL Server databases. Some third party partners have produced tools, and SSDT builds on the Visual Studio capabilities with an offline schema model, but all of these methods require the developer to take actions outside of just writing code, compiling it, clicking save, and then clicking commit.

Since the database isnâ€™t tightly linked to the code the developer works on, and we often find developers making changes to databases to test code, and then forgetting to save this in a VCS, years of bad habits have resulted in relatively few people understanding how to save their database code.

In the next section, we will look at a few ways that we can store our code, and data, in a VCS.
