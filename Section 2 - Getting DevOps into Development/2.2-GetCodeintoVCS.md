# Getting Database Code into a VCS

In this section, we will look at some practical ways that a database developer can store their database code in a VCS. For the rest of this course, we will use git as our VCS, but the principles and practices apply to any version control system.

## Getting Database Code

One of the challenges, as mentioned before, is getting your database code. Various platforms will allow you to generate the SQL code with different techniques. Since I primarily deal with the Microsoft SQL Server platform, I'll use that in my examples, but the ideas are applicable to any platform.

No matter what process you use, you will want to capture revisions to the objects, which means you need a VCS of some sort. While there are many you can use, I tend to prefer git, and I usually use the git services provided by VSTS. That is what we will use in examples and demos for this section.

## Manual Tracking of Code

If you are writing the code yourself, as in typing T-SQL into some editor, you can perform a File | Save operation to capture your code. Whether you work in Visual Studio or Management Studio, each time you create a new object, you can save your code to the file system. Each time you need to edit an object, you may need to open the file corresponding to the object code. 

However, this does mean that you need to organize your code somehow and properly name the objects. One way to do this is shown on the slide. This is what SSMS will generate for you when you script out each object in your database to a separate file. This becomes confusing quickly, especially in a manual process as the naming of the object includes the type. When trying to find a particular type of object to edit, this can be cumbersome for the developer.

Another way is to use the default SSDT structure, which is shown here in my VSTS repository. In this structure the code is stored under a folder named for the schema (dbo and auditing) with subfolders for each type of object and then a single .SQL file that is named for the object. Other items, such as users and roles, are stored under the "Security" folder at the top level.

Yet another way to manage your code is include all the objects at the top level, as shown here. This is how SQL Source Control from Redgate will setup a repository. In addition to the various SQL Server objects, there are Data and Custom Scripts folders to keep additional code.

A final way of managing your code is what many migration tools and frameworks use, which is to number your script files. Each of these files could contain code that create any type of objects, changes data, alters security, or even performs multiple changes. The naming in this case is chosen to simply the deployment process where some program will execute each script file in order.

No matter which of these you choose, all your developers will need to adopt the habit of saving their code as files in addition to compiling the code in their SQL Server database.

## Using Database Projects
If you perform development within a Database Project in Visual Studio, then much of your code is tracked within the project. As you add new types of objects, Visual Studio tracks which are committed and uncommitted to your VCS.
