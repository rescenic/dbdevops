Content: 
4 – 6 modules based around the attached syllabus that Stephanie put together (although we can still edit this if needs be).  So the modules might look like this:
a.	Introduction to Database DevOps
b.	Including your database in development practices – version control, automated builds & testing
c.	Release management and the database
d.	Monitoring databases after releases
e.	Optional - advanced topics such as provisioning for dev and test, branching & merging etc.

Format: 
A mixture of video, presentations, demos and hands-on-labs, totaling about 12 hours’ worth of effort for someone to complete the course.   So you could imagine module a) predominantly consisting of video recording of you introducing all the principles with accompanying presentations whereas module b) would be more based around demos followed by hands-on-labs (tweaking what we already have for SITC).  

MS have offered use of recording facilities in Redmond for the video elements.  MS will themselves create assessments based on our content (given that this course may in time form part of an accreditation).
