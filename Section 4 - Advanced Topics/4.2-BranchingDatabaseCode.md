# Branching and Merging Database Code

It is inevitable that code conflicts in a DevOps process will occur. The more people who work on the same system, with more rapid changes, the more likely it is that someone will write code in the same area as another person. It doesn't matter how well we coordinate our efforts with project managers, kanban boards, or any tool, we will sometimes end up making changes to the same file. In most application code system, branching and merging is used to ensure that developers don't lose work, aren't unnecessarily blocked by other developers, and have a way to easily reconcile code differences by branching and merging code.

The good news is that database code can fit into the same types of brnaching and merging strategies that many developers employ. The bad news is that merging database code can be more complex because of the nature of databases and the need to maintain state.

## Branching Issues for Databases
In an application software world, we can easily make a branch in our VCS, start writing code and compile it when we're ready. In a database world, this is a little more difficult. I can certainly branch my database code, but my code doesn't necessarily exist by itself. The code is a representation of a database, which often has data in it.

Branching my code and making changes can entail altering data in my database. For example, if I add a new column, I need to decide what data will go in there and how it gets there. I may need to add additional indexing or other structures to support these changes. In addition to the code I write to change my database, I might need other code that manipulates data.

If I want to switch branches, I can easily do that in my VCS, especially with git. However, what do I do with my database? I can't easily switch between two databases where my Sales table has 4 columns in one version and 5 in another. I almost need a new database for each branch, which can become confusing and cumbersome for many developers.
