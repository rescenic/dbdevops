# Database DevOps 

This is a working title, not necessarily the final title.

## Abstract
Learn how to extend DevOps practices to databases to prevent the database from being a blocker to DevOps success. 
 
## About this course 
To fully benefit from the value of a DevOps approach, it is important to extend the practices you are using for your application code to your database. Failing to involve your DBAs in the development and delivery of database changes will constrain your ability to learn and refine your processes and ultimately lead to your database being a bottleneck in your continuous delivery cycle.  By taking this course, you'll learn everything you need to know about the unique challenges that the database brings and how to overcome these as part of a DevOps implementation. 
 
What you'll learn 
* Importance of including your database in DevOps processes 
* Specific database challenges that need to be considered  
* How to unify processes and improve collaboration between development and DBAs 
* Source control, Continuous Integration (CI), continuous testing, and continuous deployment for the database 
* Monitoring databases after releases
