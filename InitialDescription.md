# Database DevOps 

This is a working title, not necessarily the final title.

## About this course 
To fully benefit from the value of a DevOps approach, it is important to extend the practices you are using for your application code to your database. Failing to involve your DBAs in the development and delivery of database changes will constrain your ability to learn and refine your processes and ultimately lead to your database being a bottleneck in your continuous delivery cycle.  By taking this course, you'll learn everything you need to know about the unique challenges that the database brings and how to overcome these as part of a DevOps implementation.
