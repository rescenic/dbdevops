Deliverables for the course
* (In draft) Course design > put together a course design We can do it in a doc or Markdown,  break it out at Module, Lesson and topic level including labs and exercises. Can be high level enough and if possible calling out graphics/demos/video elements where we can. We’ll also have some reviewed  from the product group and externally. We’ll act as the conduit for all that to minimise any churn to you and so you have a single voice.
* (in progress) Topic Content > the actual course topic content, 
	a.	i.e. text / graphics / references etc, 
	b.	again markdown would be preferable but doc would be possible either. We’d need all source elements for localization such as graphics be it in ppt or visio etc
* Video element > theres two parts to video
	a.	Video > conceptual topics > you could record it per module for continuity and to make it easier but we’d typically we break them up into chunks, one video element for one or two slides or thereabouts i.e. usually about 5 min chunks. You will probably need some ppt slides to help with those video elements and high level script so you know what you’re covering to be created up front before recording. We’d need the ppt handed off for localization but we wouldn’t publish it with the course.
	b.	Video  > demos > just recorded demos of practical hands on elements
	c.	I believe your planning on coming Redmond to do the video conceptual topics on Apr 24th + 25th 
	d.	It could be possible for you to record the demo videos in your own location/studio and provide .mp4 files. 
*	Write labs > Each module will have a hands on lab at the end. We’d like you to do the following
	a.	define those lab exercises (anywhere between 2 to 4 exercise tasks per module, depending on complexity and time). The most comment tasks, related back into the content
	b.	can hand them off in a doc or markdown again. I’ve attached an example in pdf of what the lab steps look like on a fundamentals course.
	c.	Provided Video recording of each exercise
* Write Assessment questions:
	a.	Module review Questions : at the end of each module there are 8 to10 questions on the preceding content. These are a learning aid to re-inforce key concepts from the module. They are not graded.
	b.	End of course exam questions: at the end of the course is a final exam : 30 questions based on the content in the course. It is graded and passing provides a certificate of course completion and exam passing
	c.	Can hand them off in a doc or markdown.
